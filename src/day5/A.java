    /**
     * 1- As soon as we create a class a default constructor is created
     *   E.g. Class A will have a default constructor A()
     *   i) Default constructor: A constructor is called "Default Constructor" when it doesn't have any parameter.
     *    ii) Parameterized constructor: A constructor which has a specific number of parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
     * 2- constructor is called during object creation or instantiation
     * 3- Constructor name must be the same as its class name
     * 4- A Constructor must have no explicit return type
     * 5- A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
     * 6- If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.
     * 7- We can overload a const by changing no of arguments , trype of arguments and sequence of arguments
     * 8- Java provides a Constructor class which can be used to get the internal information of a constructor in the class.
     *    It is found in the java.lang.reflect package.
